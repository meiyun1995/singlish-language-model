# Creating a Language Model for Singlish

Singlish is a mixture of english, chinese, malay and dialect. It is am unique and efficient way that Singaporeans used to communicate with each other. It does not adhere to any grammatical rules. Today, I attempt to build a Language model using the corpus of more than 67,000 SMS messages in sent in Singapore.
